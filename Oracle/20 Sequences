==========
- sequence is a db object.which is used to generate sequence numbers on a particular column automatically.
Syntax:
=======
Create sequence <sequence name>
[ start with n ]
[ minvalue n ]
[ increment by n ]
[ maxvalue n ]
[ no cycle / cycle ]
[ no cache / cache n ];
Parameters of sequence object:
================================
Start with n:
============
- it represent the starting sequence number.here "n" is represent witn number.
Minvalue n:
===========
- it specify the minimum value of the sequence.here "n" is represent witn number.
Increment by n:
===============
- it specify the incremental value in between sequence numbers.here "n" is represent witn number. 
Maxvalue n:
===========
- it specify the maximum value of the sequence.here "n" is represent witn number.
No cycle:
=========
- it is default parameter.if we created sequence with " no cycle " then sequence starts from start with value and 
generate values upto max value.after reaching max value then sequence is stop.
Cycle :
=======
- if we created a sequence with "cycle" then sequence starts from start with value and generate values upto 
maxvalue.after reaching max value
Then sequence will starts with minvalue.
No cache:
==========
- it is default parameter.when we created a sequence with "no cache"
Parameter then the set of sequence values are storing into database
Memory.every time we want access sequence numbers then oracle server will go to database memory and return 
to user.so that it will degrade the performance of an application.
Cache n:
========
- when we created a sequence with "cache " parameter then system is allocating temp. Memory(cache) and in this 
memory we will store the set sequence numbers.whenever user want to access sequence numbers then oracle 
server will go to cache memory and return to user.
- accessing data from cache is much faster than accessing data from database.it will increse the 
performance of an application.here "n" is represent the size of cache file.minimum size of cache is 2kb and 
maximum size of cache is 20kb.
Note:
=====
- to work with sequence object we should use the following two 
Pseudo columns are "nextval" and "currval".
Nextval:
=========
- it is used to generate sequence numbers on a particular column.
Syntax:
=======
Select <sequence name>.<nextval> from dual;
Currval:
========
- it is used to show the current value of the sequence.
Syntax:
=======
Select <sequence name>.<currval> from dual;
Ex1:
====
Step1:
-----------
Sql> create sequence sq1
 start with 1
 minvalue 1
 increment by 1
 maxvalue 3;
Sequence created.
Step2:
-----------
Sql> create table test1(sno int,name varchar2(10));
Table created.
Testing:
=========
Sql> insert into test1 values(sq1.nextval,'&name');
Enter value for name: a
/
Enter value for name: b
/
Enter value for name: c
/
Enter value for name: d
Error at line 1:
Ora-08004: sequence sq1.nextval exceeds maxvalue and cannot be instantiated.
Altering a sequence:
=====================
Syntax:
=======
Alter sequence <sequence name> <parameter name> n;
Ex:
Sql> alter sequence sq1 maxvalue 5;
Sequence altered.
Testing:
Sql> insert into test1 values(sq1.nextval,'&name');
Enter value for name: d
/
Enter value for name: e
Output:
========
Sql> select * from test1;
Sno name
------- ----------
 1 a
 2 b
 3 c
 4 d
 5 e
Note: we can alter all parameters except "start with " parameter.
=====
Ex2:
Sql> create sequence sq2
start with 1
minvalue 1
increment by 1
maxvalue 3
cycle
cache 2;
Sequence created.
Sql> create table test2(sno int,name varchar2(10));
Table created.
Testing:
========
Sql> insert into test2 values(sq2.nextval,'&name');
Enter value for name: a
/
Enter value for name: b
/
Enter value for name: c
/
.....................................
.....................................
Output:
========
Sql> select * from test2;
Sno name
------- ----------
 1 a
 2 b
 3 c
 1 d
 2 e
 3 f
Ex3:
====
Sql> create sequence sq3
start with 3
minvalue 1
increment by 1
maxvalue 5
cycle
cache 2;
Sequence created.
Sql> create table test3(sno int,name varchar2(10));
Table created.
Testing:
=========
Sql> insert into test3 values(sq3.nextval,'&name');
Enter value for name: a
/
......................................
......................................
Output:
========
Sql> select * from test3;
 sno name
-------------- ----------
 3 a
 4 b
 5 c
 1 m
 2 n
 3 o
 4 p
 5 q
Note: if we want to view all sequences in oracle database then we use
"user_sequences" data dictionary.
Ex:
Sql> desc user_sequences;
Sql> select sequence_name from user_sequences;
Syntax to drop a sequence:
===========================
Sql> drop sequence <sequence name>;
Ex:
Sql> drop sequence sq1;
