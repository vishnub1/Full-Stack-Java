Synonyms:
====================================================
> it a db object to create permanant alias names for 
Db objects like table,view,procedure ................etc.
> synonym is nothing but alternative name for db objects like 
Table ,view,procedure.....
> synonyms are created to reduce lengthy table name.

Types:
------------
1. Private synonym (default)
2. Public synonym


1.private synonyms:
---------------------------------------
> these synonyms are created by users which have permission.
Syntax:
---------------
Create synonym <synonym name> for [username].<db object name>;

Ex:
Sql> conn scott/tiger;
Sql> create user u1 identified by u1;
Sql> grant connect,resource to u1; 
Sql> conn u1/u1;

Sql> create table studentdetails(stid int,sname varchar2(10));
Sql> insert into studentdetails values(1021,'sai');
Sql> insert into studentdetails values(1022,'jones');
Sql> commit;

Sql> create synonym syn1 for studentdetails;
Error at line 1:
Ora-01031: insufficient privileges

Sql> conn scott/tiger;
Sql> grant create synonym to u1;
Grant succeeded.

Sql> conn u1/u1;
Sql> create synonym syn1 for studentdetails;
Synonym created.

Note: once we created synonym insted of using table name we can use 
 synonym name for accessing data / to perform db operations on table.

Testing:
-----------------
Sql> select * from syn1; 
Sql> insert into syn1 values(1023,'miller');
Sql> update syn1 set sname='scott' where stid=1022;
Sql> delete from syn1 where stid=1023;


2. Public synonyms:
--------------------------------------
> these synonyms are created by dba.
> we should have "create public synonym " privilege.and it can accessing 
By all users.
> for hiding the information about username,object name(table).

Syntax:
---------------
Create public synonym <synonym name> for [user name].<db object name>;
Ex:
Sql> conn scott/tiger;
Sql> create public synonym pub_syn for dept;
Sql> grant all on pub_syn to u1,u2,u3;
(or)
Sql> grant all on pub_syn to public;
Sql> conn u1/u1;
Sql> select * from pub_syn;---allowed
Sql> conn u2/u2;
Sql> select * from pub_syn;---allowed


Note:
-----------
Once we created public synonym then any user can access that public
Synonym without "username".

Note:
-----------
To view all synonyms information in oracle db then we use 
"user_synonyms" datadictionary.
Ex:
Sql> desc user_synonyms;
Sql> select synonym_name,table_name from user_synonyms;

Note:
-----------
To view all private and public synonyms of a particular user in oracle 
Database then we "all_synonyms" datadictionary.

Ex:
Sql> desc all_synonyms;
Sql> select synonym_name,table_name from all_synonyms where table_name='dept';


Syntax to drop synonyms:
----------------------------------------------------
Sql> drop synonym <synonym name>;
Ex:
Sql> drop synonym syn_dept;
> in this case we dropping private synonyms only and dropping by user.
Sql> drop public synonym <synonym name>;
Ex:
Sql> drop public synonym pub_syn;
> in this case we dropping public synonyms only and dropping by dba.
